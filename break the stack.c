// Chef has a stick of length 
// N. He can break the stick into 2 or more parts such that the parity of length of each part is same. For example, a stick of length 11 can be broken into three sticks of lengths  {3,3,5}
//  since each part is odd, but it cannot be broken into two sticks of lengths 
// {5,6}since one is even and the other is odd.

// Chef can then continue applying this operation on the smaller sticks he obtains, as many times as he likes.
// Can Chef obtain a stick of length exactly X by doing this?
