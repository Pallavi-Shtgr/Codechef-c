// Even Sum Subarray
// Given an array A of size N, find the size of the largest subarray of 𝐴
// A which has an even sum.For example, for the array 
// [2,1,2][2,1,2] the answer is just 11 as the largest subarray with an even sum is [2][2].
// Note that a subarray is a contiguous part of an array. For the array 
// [1,3,2][1,3,2], some possible subarrays are [1],[2],[1,3],[1,3,2[1],[2],[1,3],[1,3,2]. However,[1,2] [1,2] is not a subarray for this array.
