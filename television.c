// Television Channels
// You have a television which had 
// 𝑋
// X working channels numbered 1,2,...,X. Unfortunately, due to a recent change, all even-numbered channels stopped working.
// For example if X=5, channels numbered 2 and 4 have stopped working , while channels numbered 3 and 5 are still working.
// Given X, can you tell how many channels are still working?
